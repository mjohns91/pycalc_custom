# Python Calculator (AST-Based Evaluation)
This is a simple yet secure calculator application built with Python and tkinter, featuring a graphical user interface and safe expression evaluation using Python's ast module. Unlike calculators that use eval(), this project parses and evaluates mathematical expressions through an abstract syntax tree (AST), ensuring better security and control over allowed operations.

**Features:**
- Intuitive GUI using tkinter
- Secure math expression evaluation (no eval())
- Supports basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /, **, and parentheses
- Error handling for invalid inputs
